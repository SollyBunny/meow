# meow
## An HTML cat cursor

This a little webtoy based on [Webneko](https://webneko.net/).

You can find the excessively overdesigned website [here](https://sollybunny.xyz/meow/)!

## Usage
1. Download [`cat.js`](https://github.com/SollyBunny/meow/blob/main/cat.js)
2. Include using a script tag
	```html
	<script src="cat.js"></script>
	```
3. Optionally, add a `<meowbed>` element to specify where the cat will spawn (multiple can be placed for the cat to spawn in a random one)
	```html
	<meowbed></meowbed>
	```
4. Enjoy having a cat on your screen!
